\paragraph{Q1.} is there Random Reshuffling -PAGE ? is it possible to accelerate "random shuffling "or the variants of random reshuffling or is there result on this(at least I don't find)? is there Proximal random reshuffling?
\paragraph{Q2.}In "A Geometric Structure of Acceleration and Its Role in Making Gradients Small Fast", they proposed accelerated method and proved
\begin{equation}
	\left\|\nabla f\left(x_{K}\right)\right\|^{2} \leq \frac{C L}{(K+2)^{2}}\left(f\left(x_{0}\right)-f_{\star}\right),	
\end{equation}
this is different from the usual
\begin{equation*}
	f\left(x_{K}\right)-f^{*} \leq \frac{C L}{(K+1)^{2} }\left\|x_{0}-x^{*}\right\|_{2}^{2},
\end{equation*}
combining the two bound, we can get
\begin{equation*}
	\left\|\nabla f\left(x_{2K}\right)\right\|^{2} \leq  \frac{C L^2}{(K+1)^{4} }\left\|x_{0}-x^{*}\right\|_{2}^{2}.
\end{equation*}
So I wonder if it is possible to get some results under stochastic gradient(sampling, compression, or with variance reduction) setting?

If you can comment on these questions based on your knowledge, that will save me a lot of time.
